# Meeting Timer: User Guide & Documentation

Welcome to the **Meeting Timer**! This tool is a high-visibility, efficient solution for timing speeches, evaluations, and impromptu sessions. It is designed to scale across **smartphones, tablets, and desktops**, ensuring the timer is visible to everyone in the room.

### ⚠️ Important: Data Privacy & Storage
**All data is stored locally on your device.** To ensure your privacy, this app does not use a cloud database. Speaker names, club settings, and meeting logs are stored entirely within your device's web browser memory (**Local Storage**).

* **Device Specific:** If you save a roster on a tablet, those names will **not** appear when you open the app on a phone or laptop.
* **Browser Specific:** If you switch from one browser to another (e.g., from Chrome to Firefox) on the same device, you will need to re-enter your settings.
* **Clearing Cache:** Clearing your browser history or "Website Data" will delete your saved speaker roster and meeting logs.

### 1. Getting Started (Main Menu)
When you first launch the app, you will see the **Main Menu**.

* **Set Your Club Name:** Tap the blue subtitle at the top (e.g., *"Tap to set club name"*) to personalize the app. This name will appear on your final reports.
* **Navigation:**
    * **New Timer:** Opens the setup screen to start a timing session.
    * **Meeting Report:** Displays the log of all speakers timed during the current meeting.
    * **Clear Meeting Logs:** Use this at the start of a new meeting to wipe previous data.

### 2. Setting Up a Speech
The **Speech Info** screen is built for speed and ease of use.

* **Enter/Search Speaker:**
    * Start typing a name in the box. The text will automatically convert to **UPPERCASE**.
    * **The Roster:** Your saved members will appear in a list below the search box. Tap a name to select them instantly.
    * **Adding New Names:** Type a new name and tap **Add**. The name is saved to your local roster and remains selected in the input box so you can start timing immediately.
    * **Managing Roster:** Tap the small **✕** next to a name to remove them from your device's memory.
* **Select Speech Type:** Tap one of the four preset cards (**Table Topics, Evaluation, Speech, or Ice Breaker**).
    * **Custom Time:** For unique requirements, tap Custom Time to enter specific Green, Yellow, and Red thresholds in a single pop-up modal.
* **Launch:** Tap the large blue **START TIMING** button at the bottom.

### 3. Using the Timer
The timer screen provides maximum visibility for the speaker. **The timer starts automatically** the moment this screen appears.

#### Visual Indicators (Color Changes):
* **White/Neutral:** Timing is active, but the minimum time has not been reached.
* **Green:** Minimum time reached.
* **Yellow:** Mid-point reached.
* **Red:** Maximum time reached.

#### Controls:
* **PAUSE/RESUME:** Toggles the clock if the speaker is interrupted.
* **RESET:** Zeroes the clock if the speaker needs to start over.
* **COMMIT & EXIT:** When the speech is finished, tap this to save the time to the report and return to the menu. **Note:** You must tap this to save the time to the meeting report.

### 4. Viewing and Sharing Reports
Once you have timed your speakers, head to the **Meeting Report**.

* **The Log:** A list of every speaker, their speech category, and their final recorded time.
* **Sharing:** Tap **Share Report**.
    * On mobile devices, this opens the native share menu (Text, Email, etc.).
    * On desktops or devices without a share menu, the report is **copied to your clipboard** automatically so you can "Paste" it into an email or document.

### 5. Advanced Tips
* **Large Screen Visibility:** On tablets and desktops, the timer text scales to be as large as possible. This allows you to place the device at the front of the room where it can be seen from the back row.
* **Offline Use:** Because all data is stored locally, the app works without an internet connection once it has been loaded into your browser.
* **Install as an App:**
    * **Android/Chrome:** Tap the three dots in Chrome and select **"Install App"** or **"Add to Home Screen."**
    * **iOS/Safari:** Tap the **Share** icon and select **"Add to Home Screen."**
    * **Desktop:** Most modern browsers will show an "Install" icon in the address bar to save the timer as a standalone desktop application.
